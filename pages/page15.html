You can feel it too can't you.
This burning sensation that these are people.
I don't know why, but you must be feeling it too.

Maybe we didn't succumb to an epic uprising of creatures
Maybe we just, evolved?? Somehow in someway
that made us be able to be, like, anything.
That explanation makes sense atleast.

Unless you'd like to believe fish people, demons and dogs
all united to take us over for some reason.
