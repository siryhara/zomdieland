Great. you took two steps forward and got out of the alley
Amazing! Really, this might be your greatest achiviement yet
Now keep going and we might do something actually meaningful?

Hm? Do i always talk this much?
Why yes you stumbling piece of shit, i do always talk this much
and i'll go on and on about a certain thing, you won't get tired of me!

I however will, get tired of you, so hurry up. We gotta solve our hunger issue
And yes! You do smell horrible, i know you're curious, since you've asked.
I do doubt that it is purely because you we're in a garbage bin.
It might be more natural! 
Take it as a sign to take a bath.
And also a sign of my impatience manifesting.
